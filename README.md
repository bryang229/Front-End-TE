# Front End TE
This is a front end *demo* of how to make a javascript front end website that is connected to a flask backend.

# Libraries
- Axios: [https://axios-http.com/docs/intro](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)
  - Add this to your html when using axios for that page `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>`
  - This library is used for sending POST requests to our Flask Backend
- Js-Cookie: [https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie](https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie)
  - Add this to your html when using cookies for that page `<script src = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/js-cookie@2/src/js.cookie.min.js"></script>`
  - Cookies allow us to keep some information of the user stored even when they leave the page allowing us to keep a user signed in
